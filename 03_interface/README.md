# Interface
You will learn use the interfaces in this module. A java interface can be understood in two ways:
- a contract: you want to be a "Closesable" ? you have to implement that.
- a capability: you want to be a "Fighter" ? you have to know how to hit somebody

It is well known that when using an interface, you can hide the actual implementation, but for me the main advantage is
that you can use it without having implementing existing implementation.

# Steps

Write your solution in [src/main/java/com/qmt/tutorial/fighter](src/main/java/com/qmt/tutorial/fighter) then run
"mvn clean install"

Karateka and Swordman must be able to fight and their attack are "random" and depending on their strength.
