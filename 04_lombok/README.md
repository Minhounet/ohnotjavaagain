# lombok

(Lombok)[https://projectlombok.org] project is a very cool project which make Java less verbose. If you remember the [pojo](../01_pojo)
you can think that this is a lot of code for nothing very interesting. Maybe you also remember suffering when implementing
[equals hashchode and toString](../02_equals_hashcode_tostring).

You will learn to use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. Thanks to Lombok, creating a pojo, implementing equals, hashCode
is made easier.
