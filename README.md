# ohnotjavaagain
I am in a position where I have to raise the level of a colleague in Java pretty quickly (3 months).
There are so many Java tutorials in the internet but I wanted to keep it very simple and pretty pragmatic.

I want anyone to be able to go in a Java project quickly, this is the aim of this repo. You are an advanced Java programmer ? You should not need this repo but I am opene to any remarks !

# Modules (WIP)
