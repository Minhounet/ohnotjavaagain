# ohnotjavaagain
I am in a position where I have to raise the level of a colleague in Java pretty quickly (3 months).
There are so many Java tutorials in the internet, but I wanted to keep it very simple and pretty pragmatic.

I want anyone to be able to go in a Java project quickly, this is the aim of this repo. You are an advanced Java programmer ? You should not need this repo, but I am open to any remarks !

# Summary

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [How to test your solution](#how-to-test-your-solution)
- [Modules](#modules)
  - [01 pojo](#01-pojo) 

# Prerequisites

You must have installed [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and be able to execute it in this project.

# How to test your solution
Go a module, for example [01_pojo](01_pojo) then run
```bash
mvn clean install
```

If you pass the unit tests, it means that your solution is correct (not necessary the best, but it is working for sure)

Solution is laying in tags: `git checkout solution/01_pojo` will show you the solution for [01_pojo](01_pojo). Next solution
will include the previous ones.

# Modules

## 01 pojo

Learn to create a plain old java object, this is the very basis ! Go to [01_pojo](01_pojo).
